 PICK A RANDOM CARD USING PYTHON
 
My program layout:

stage 1:
store card data in data structure 
I did it using 2 lists
1- storing the suits
2-for storing the rank of the cards

stage 2:
import the 'random' python built-in module
I found that 'choices' method was the most apposite method for this program
'choices' - Returns a list with a random selection from the given sequence.

stage 3:
creating the function

stage 4:
printing output and calling the function!
